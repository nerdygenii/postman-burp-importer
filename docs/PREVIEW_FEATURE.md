# Request Preview & Selection

The Request Preview feature allows you to analyze your Postman collection before import, providing detailed insights into requests, variables, and potential issues while enabling selective import of specific requests.

## üîç Overview

### What is Request Preview?
Request Preview analyzes your Postman collection and displays a comprehensive table showing all requests, their properties, variable status, and potential issues before you commit to importing them.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Preview Not Loading

#### Collection Issues
**Problem**: Preview fails to generate or shows errors

**Solutions**:
- Verify collection file is valid JSON format
- Check that collection uses v2.0 or v2.1 format
- Ensure file is not corrupted or truncated
- Try with a smaller or simpler collection first

#### Environment Problems
**Problem**: Variables not resolving despite environment file

**Solutions**:
- Verify environment file matches collection requirements
- Check variable name spelling and case sensitivity
- Ensure environment file is valid JSON
- Try manual variable entry as alternative

### Selection Issues

#### Checkboxes Not Working
**Problem**: Cannot select or deselect requests

**Solutions**:
- Ensure preview has finished loading completely
- Try refreshing preview by re-clicking "Preview Requests"
- Check that collection analysis completed successfully
- Verify UI is responsive (not frozen or busy)

#### Bulk Operations Failing
**Problem**: Select All or Clear All buttons not working

**Solutions**:
- Wait for preview to complete loading
- Try individual selections first to test functionality
- Check for JavaScript errors in Burp Suite console
- Restart Burp Suite if UI becomes unresponsive

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Preview Generation
**Problem**: Preview takes very long to generate

**Solutions**:
- Try with smaller collection to test functionality
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Increase Burp Suite memory allocation
- Consider splitting large collections into smaller files

#### Memory Problems
**Problem**: Out of memory errors during preview

**Solutions**:
- Increase Java heap size for Burp Suite
- Close unnecessary tabs and tools in Burp Suite
- Use selective import instead of full collection
- Process collection in smaller batches
